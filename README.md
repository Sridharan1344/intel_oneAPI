we conducted a performance comparison between different machine learning models, specifically linear regression and decision tree regression, to predict the performance metric of CPU and GPU combinations. We evaluated the performance of these models based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The results of our performance comparison indicated that both linear regression and decision tree regression models achieved comparable accuracy in predicting the performance metric. However, we observed differences in their performance across different evaluation metrics.

Linear regression exhibited higher precision and recall for certain subsets of data, indicating its ability to make more accurate predictions for specific CPU and GPU configurations. On the other hand, decision tree regression demonstrated higher accuracy and F1-score overall, suggesting its effectiveness in capturing complex relationships between features and the performance metric.

Additionally, we analyzed the computational efficiency of both models, considering factors such as training time and inference speed. While linear regression generally had faster training times, decision tree regression showed faster inference speeds, particularly for larger datasets.

Overall, our performance comparison provided valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each machine learning model in predicting the performance metric of CPU and GPU combinations. These findings can inform the selection of the most suitable model based on specific requirements and preferences, ultimately improving the accuracy and efficiency of our predictions.
